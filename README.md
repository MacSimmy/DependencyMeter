# DependencyMeter
Will show dependency between classes, interfaces, package and modules of project. So that one can measure the impact of changing any class file. 
Simply if you change any behaviour or code in any class, it will tell you what are the areas could be impacted by this change, so that it doesnot break anything. It can show direct dependency and also one can find n level deep dependency also.
